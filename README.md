## Features

- When users arrive at the home page, they are prompted with a call to action to either `login` or `signup`.

- Once users log in or sign up, they are redirected to the `search` page. This page allows users to search for an opportunity by keyword and filter by state.

- Users are presented with their search `results`; an image of the opportunity, title, who to contact about the opportunity, and the option to save.

- Users can access their saved opportunities and any opportunities they have created on their `profile`. Here, users can delete any saved opportunities and edit or delete any they have created.

- If a user would like to add an opportunity, they click `create` in the navbar. This brings users to a create form where they can submit

## Work in Progress

The following features of the Assist application are works in progress or (WIP).

- Filtering `searches` by keyword
- Rendering content from `create form` onto cards that render to a user's `profile` and displays in the `search`
- User can `save` opportunities to their `profile`
- Using an additional `API` to pull from even more opportunities
- Creation of `calendar` page so users can manage their opportunities and see upcoming events near them
- Color-code `search` result cards based on when the event is happening. Grey = past, red = currently happening, yellow = in a few days, green = 1+ week(s) away.
